  #  This method dectects which attributes were changed from the model update,
  #  and sends a notification signalling each attribute change.  This provides
  #  several benefits over signalling the atribute changes in the controller.
  #  First, we can emit notifications directly from teh model, thus aid in test
  #  data generation and unit testing.  Second, we can have the notifications all
  #  in one central place, as opposed to being scattered throughout the
  #  controllers
