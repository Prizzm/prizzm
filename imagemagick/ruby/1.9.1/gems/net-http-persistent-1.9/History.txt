=== 1.9 / 2011-08-26

* Minor Enhancement
  * Added Net::HTTP::Persistent#cert_store to set an SSL certificate store
    which defaults to the OpenSSL default certificate store.

    HTTPS server certificates will be validated when this option is combined
    with setting Net::HTTP::Persistent#verify_mode to
    OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER.

=== 1.8.1 / 2011-08-08

* Bug Fix
  * Requests with OpenSSL errors are retried now.  Pull Request #5 by James
    Tucker.

=== 1.8 / 2011-06-27

* Minor Enhancement
  * Added Net::HTTP::Persistent#retry_change_requests which allows POST and
    other non-idempotent requests to be retried automatically.  Take care when
    enabling this option to ensure the server will handle multiple POSTs with
    the same data in a sane manner.

=== 1.7 / 2011-04-17

* Minor Enhancement
  * Added Net::HTTP::Persistent#pipeline which integrates with
    net-http-pipeline when it is present.
* Bug Fix
  * Perform a case-insensitive check of the URI scheme for HTTPS URIs

=== 1.6.1 / 2011-03-08

* Bug Fix
  * Net::HTTP::Persistent#request now handles Errno::EINVAL as a connection
    reset and will be retried for idempotent requests.  Reported by Aaron
    Qian.

=== 1.6 / 2011-03-01

* Minor Enhancement
  * Added Net::HTTP::Persistent#socket_options to set multiple socket options
    at socket startup.

=== 1.5.2 / 2011-02-24

* Bug Fix
  * Only set TCP_NODELAY if the connection has an @socket.  Allows
    net-http-persistent to be used with fake_web.  Reported by Sathish
    Pasupunuri.

=== 1.5.1 / 2011-02-10

* Bug fix
  * Only set TCP_NODELAY at connection start.  Reported by Brian Henderson.

=== 1.5 / 2011-01-25

* Minor Enhancements
  * Set TCP_NODELAY on created socket if possible.  (This will only help for
    requests that send bodies.)

=== 1.4.1 / 2010-10-13

* Bug Fixes
  * Don't finish the connection when we're retrying, reset it.  Patch by James
    Tucker.

    Patch by Torsten Sch√∂nebaum.

* Bug Fixes
  * Fix example code (pointed out by Alex Stahl)

=== 1.2.2 / 2010-06-22

* Bug Fixes
  * #request only finishes a connection instead of restarting it.  This helps
    prevents errors on non-idempotent HTTP requests after errors.
  * #connection_for handles EHOSTDOWN like #reset

=== 1.2.1 / 2010-05-25

* Bug Fixes
  * Don't alter Net::BufferedIO#rbuf_fill on 1.9+
