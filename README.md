## Css compilation with Compass

Css for this project is stored in the sass files under the "app/stylesheets" directory.  We then
compile the sass into css before deploying to heroku. 

Make sure that you are running at least Compass 0.11.1

  gem install compass

Then go to the Rails root, and either compile one time by running

  compass compile .

or continuously watch all sass files and compile once they are updated with

  compass watch .
